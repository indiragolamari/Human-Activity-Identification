# Human Activity Recognition Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project involves developing a deep learning model to recognize human activities like walking, waving, and jumping using depth maps and skeleton posture data.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Keras/TensorFlow (Deep Learning)
- Tkinter (GUI)
- NumPy, Matplotlib (Data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Metrics & Evaluation)

## Features:
- Real-time activity recognition using CNNs and RNNs.
- Visualize 3D data using Matplotlib.
- GUI interface built using Tkinter to load and display skeleton data.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Run `human_activity_identification.py` to start the application.
